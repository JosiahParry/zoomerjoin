# zoomerjoin [![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

INSANELY, BLAZINGLY FAST fuzzy joins in R. Implimented using
[MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash) to cut down on the number of
comparisons that need to be made in calculating matches. This results in
matches that return orders of magnitude faster than other matches.

#### Installation

---

##### Installing Rust:

You must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed to
compile this package. The rust website provides an excellent installation
script that has never caused me any issues.

On Linux or MacOs, you can install Rust with:

``` sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

On Windows, I use the rust installation wizard, found
[here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html).

##### Installing Package from Github:

Once you install Rust, you should be able to install the package with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")
```

### Usage:

---

The package provides the following functions, which are designed to be near to
drop-ins for the corresponding dplyr/fuzzyjoin commands:

* `lsh_left_join()`
* `lsh_right_join()`
* `lsh_inner_join()`
* `lsh_full_join()`
* `lsh_anti_join()`

Here's a snippet showing off how to use the `lhs_left_join()` command:

I start with two corpses I would like to combine, `corpus_1`:

```{r}
corpus_1
```

And `corpus_2`:
```{r}
corpus_2
```

The two Corpuses can't be directly joined because of misspellings. This means
we must use the fuzzy-matching capabilities of zoomerjoin:

```{r}
start_time <- Sys.time()
join_out <- lsh_inner_join(corpus_1, corpus_2, n_gram_width=6, n_bands=20, band_width=6)
print(Sys.time() - start_time)
print(join_out)
```

ZoomerJoin finds and joins on the matching rows in just a few seconds.
