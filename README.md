# ZoomerJoin <img src='logo.png' align="right" height="150">

INSANELY, BLAZINGLY FAST fuzzy joins in R. Implimented using
[MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash), such that each record
does not have to be compared to all other records when matching. This
results in matches that return orders of magnitude faster than other
matching packages.

# Installation

## Installing Rust:

You must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed
to compile this package. The rust website provides an excellent
installation script that has never caused me any issues.

On Linux, you can install Rust with:

``` sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

On Windows, I use the rust installation wizard, found
[here](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html).

## Installing Package from Github:

Once you install rust, you should be able to install the package with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/zoomerjoin")
```

# Usage:

The package provides the following functions, which are designed to be
near to drop-ins for the corresponding dplyr/fuzzyjoin commands:

- `lsh_left_join()`
- `lsh_right_join()`
- `lsh_inner_join()`
- `lsh_full_join()`
- `lsh_anti_join()`

Here’s a snippet showing off how to use the `lhs_left_join()` command:

``` r
corpus_1
```

## Benchmarks:

Here’s a quick and dirty benchmark showing the performance of this
package realative to the default standard, `fuzzyjoin`:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

## Limiting the Number of Threads:

To constrain the number of cores the program uses, you can set the
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS` variable before running the search. At present, this
variable is read at the construction of the multithreading thread pool,
and so must be set once each R session. In a future version, I’ll work
to include a fix so that the number of threads can be included in an
argument to the `lhs_join` functions.

Here’s an example of how to set the function to run on an single core in
R:

``` r
Sys.setenv(RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1)
```
