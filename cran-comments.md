## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed a large data file accidentally included in the vignettes/ directory
which caused the package tarball to be too large for CRAN
* Removed some unnecessary documentation included with rust sources to bring
the package size down to  < 5 MB
